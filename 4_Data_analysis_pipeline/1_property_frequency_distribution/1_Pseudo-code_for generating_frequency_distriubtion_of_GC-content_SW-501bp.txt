Read each chromosme Fasta file (DNA sequence) after trimming “N”
create GC-content_table as matrix of two dimensional (column = 2,row = 101)
loop for i between 0 to 100:
	GC-content_table[i][0]= i
Window = 501
loop for each chromosome fasta file:
	Length = Length of chromosome fasta file 
	loop for i between 0 to (Length - Window):
		Seq = get DNA seqence between i to (i+window)
		GC_count = count the number of ‘G’ and ‘C’ in Seq 
	%GC = (GC_count / Window)*100
	GC-content_table[%GC][1]= GC-content_table[%GC][1] + 1  		
Print GC-content_table
